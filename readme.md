## JWT-Authentication-Laravel

To fully understand how JWTs are used, we have to shift our thinking a bit. Traditional authentication requires that the server store the user's authentication information which is checked every time the user makes a request. This method creates challenges when the application grows and needs to scale up, especially if it is distributed across several different servers. It also becomes problematic when we want to use our API for other purposes, such as for mobile applications.

For this i have used Angular 4 as Front end and Php Laravel as backend
